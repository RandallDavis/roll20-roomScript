# roll20-roomScript

### *Note: This project has been absorbed into a more sophisticated script found at: https://github.com/RandallDavis/roll20-areaMapper*

With this, you can import any image and declare it a "room". Rooms can be quickly customized to draw dynamic lighting around them, including doors that can be toggled. A closed door blocks line of sight - an open door lets line of sight through but not through the surrounding walls.

Adhoc walls and doors can be used to piece together more complex rooms.

Everything is done through one command that intuitively presents action buttons based on what is selected. This includes extensive (and interactive) help documentation.

Type __!api-room__ in the chat window to get started!
